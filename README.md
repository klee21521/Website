# Boba

<h2><strong>History</strong></h1>

<p>Boba has had a long history. It is the combination of milk tea and black pearls. The black pearls are make of tapioca starch. Milk tea is just milk and tea. Later on in it's history, boba got introduced to many new flavors. These new flavors include taro, thai, brown suger, and many more. Fruit teas were also invented. People also started putting other stuff as substitutes for boba pearls, this can be red beans, lychee jelly, or even aiyu jelly. Boba has made a lasting impression on humans as a whole, especially asians. Asians love boba, especially chinese and taiwanese asians since it originates from there. Boba is a staple drink/food of asian culture.</p>
<h2><strong>Is boba a drink or a food?</strong></h2>

<p>Boba can be debated to be a drink or a food, since you drink the milk tea but also eat the pearls. In my opinion, it is a drink <strong>and</strong> a food. This is because when you have boba, as in the drink and the pearls, you call it "are you drinking boba?" However, when one eats only the pearls, you call it are you eating boba?" Therefore boba is reffered to as a drink and a food since it can refer to the drink along with the pearls, or just the pearls themselves. One has the potential to argue that boba is mainly milk tea, so it should be a drink. This is wrong because you can also have boba as a lot of pearls compared to milk tea, a complete opposite ratio. This means that the boba pearls are also boba. This leads to the argument that boba pearls are boba while milk tea is just milk tea, which makes sense to some extent, but if you combine the two, they are still referred to as boba. Technically, boba is a drink and a food. The drink being the one that combines milk tea with boba pearls, and the food being solely just the boba pearls. This makes sense because everyone refers to boba and milk tea together as 'boba.' However, when boba pearls are by themselves, they are refered to as boba or boba pearls, never tapioca pearls. This means that the general public has already accepted the fact that boba pearls are called boba, therefore boba is technically both a food and a drink.</p>
